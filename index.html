            <h2 class="abstract white">The past two decades have seen the BBC rocked by a series of
                scandals that raised questions about its culture and practices –
                and tested its relationship with politicians and the public alike.

                    <p class="introduction">In the entrance to the BBC’s
                        London headquarters,
                        Broadcasting House, there’s
                        an interesting Latin inscription that refers to broadcasting in the original biblical sense of
                        scattering
                        seed: “And they pray that good seed sown
                        may bring forth good harvest, and that
                        all things foul or hostile to peace may be
                        banished thence, and that the people inclining their ear to whatsoever things are honest,
                        whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
                        things are of good report, may tread the
                        path of virtue and wisdom.”
                        In the years since those words were
                        inscribed, “things foul or hostile” have proved
                        frustratingly hard to erase. And the BBC has
                        been rocked by a number of scandals erupting from within its own portals. As The
                        Guardian’s Charlotte Higgins observed, the
                        BBC “is where the British gather to fight their
                        most vicious culture wars… it has crisis in its
                        bones”. But some fights prove more damaging
                        than others. And over the past two decades,
                        a 24-hours-a-day media world has made it
                        easier than ever for its opponents to amplify
                        any mistakes – large and small. Nor has an
                        increasingly nervy BBC always defended
                        itself well against their attacks.
                        The first major crisis of the new century
                        to hit the BBC concerned the invasion of
                        Iraq by British and American forces, and
                        precipitated a bitter falling out with Tony
                        Blair’s government. Hostilities opened on
                        the morning of 29 May 2003 with a soonto-be-infamous broadcast on Radio 4. Just
                        after 6am, the Today programme’s defence
                        correspondent, Andrew Gilligan, took to the
                        microphone to talk about the latest twist in
                        the saga of Iraq’s elusive “weapons of mass
                        destruction” – weapons the government had
                        suggested could be launched against British
                        interests within 45 minutes, and which had
                        therefore become a major justification for
                        military intervention. Gilligan now suggested
                        not just that the 45-minute figure mentioned
                        in an intelligence dossier was wrong but that
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    the government had known it was wrong.
                    Worse, he claimed that Downing Street
                    had ordered the same document to be “sexed
                    up, to be made more exciting”. In other
                    words, a BBC correspondent was making
                    the incendiary claim that the prime minister
                    had deliberately misled the nation – and he
                    made the claim on a breakfast programme
                    that often set the day’s news agenda for the
                    national media.
                    The response from Downing Street’s
                    press operation, led by Alastair Campbell,
                    was speedy and unrelenting. As well as
                    denying the story outright, Campbell accused
                    Today of basing its report on a single anonymous and uncorroborated source. With the
                    BBC’s director general, Greg Dyke, resolutely
                    standing by Gilligan, what began as a dispute
                    over a reporter’s choice of words in a single
                    interview rapidly blew up into a debilitating
                    conflict over journalistic standards.
                    Several weeks later, Gilligan’s source
                    was revealed: David Kelly, the former UN
                    weapons inspector. Soon after, Kelly went
                    missing from his Oxfordshire home. And on
                    Friday 18 July his body was found slumped
                    against a tree: he had taken his own life. The
                    subsequent inquiry into the circumstances
                    surrounding his death, led by Brian Hutton,
                    the former Lord Chief Justice of Northern
                    Ireland, published its findings the following
                    January. They contained devastating criticism of the Today programme’s editorial
                    processes: Gilligan’s central allegations had
                    been “unfounded” and the editorial system
                    that allowed him to make his claims had
                    been “defective”. Within 24 hours, the BBC’s
                    chairman, Gavyn Davies, and the director
                    general had both resigned, while a caretaker
                    chairman, Richard Ryder, had apologised
                    “unreservedly” for the BBC’s failures.
                    There were plenty inside the BBC, especially in its news departments, who felt that
                    the government and corporation had each
                    overreacted.

                <p class="paragraph width-half white">A 2004 government review
                    suggested the intelligence on which the
                    government relied had indeed been “seriously flawed” – a finding the Chilcot Inquiry
                    would later reinforce. In the immediate
                    aftermath of the row, Kevin Marsh, Today’s
                    editor, pointed out that “very senior sources”
                    had also confirmed many of the details in
                    Gilligan’s report. The BBC’s man had been
                    substantially right. He had also been prepared properly by his editorial team: it was
                    merely his loose phrasing in the heat of a live
                    conversation which had caused the problem.
                    Many fellow journalists feared a longterm chilling effect on the corporation’s news
                    instincts. Yet the BBC’s former business
                    editor, Robert Peston, later claimed he for
                    one never “felt haunted by Hutton”. Roger
                    Mosey, who ran television news at the time,
                    also described a subtle recalibration taking
                    hold after Hutton: a BBC that was simply
                    reasserting its commitment to higher
                    standards of proof.
                    From the historian’s point of view, what’s
                    perhaps most striking about this whole
                    episode is what it reveals about the huge
                    influence of newspaper values on BBC
                    journalism during this period. There was a
                    constant turnover of staff between Fleet Street
                    and the corporation, and in the BBC’s
                    newsrooms a great deal of time and attention
                    was devoted to perusing the press, especially
                    the Mail and Telegraph. The result, accordingto the Financial Times journalist John Lloyd,
                    had been not just a newspaper culture ravenous for conflict but also a BBC that had come
                    to believe that “this was the way true journalists should behave”. If so, the recalibration
                    Mosey described was probably overdue. </p>

                    <h2>Institutional failings</h2>
                    <p>The 2012 row over Jimmy Savile also touched
                        on journalistic standards. But it sent shockwaves well beyond the BBC’s newsrooms.
                        When Savile’s death was announced in
                        October 2011, reporters on Newsnight were
                        preparing an expose of his tawdry history of
                        sexual abuse. Their investigation was then
                        halted, leaving a team from ITV to broadcast
                        the allegations a few months later. Had the
                        corporation’s senior executives intervened
                        because a tribute show was also being
                        planned for the Christmas schedules?
                        Had they feared what would emerge about
                        historical allegations of abuse committed by
                        Savile at the BBC? Or was it both? Given the
                        whiff of a cover-up and swirling rumours of
                        sex offenders on the payroll, the BBC felt it
                        had little option but to expose itself to some
                        very public investigations.
                        The first of these, conducted by the former
                        ITN journalist Nick Pollard, would eventually
                        clear Newsnight and senior managers of improper attempts to suppress the truth.
                        The real issue, Pollard concluded, had been
                        an editorial decision that set the bar of proof
                        too high by insisting that the testimony of
                        those women who were Savile’s victims was
                        not in itself sufficient for the BBC to proceed.
                        By now, the crisis had escalated horribly.
                        In what appeared to be an attempt to prove
                        its commitment to robust investigative
                        journalism, Newsnight alleged that a senior
                        Conservative had been involved in child
                        abuse. He wasn’t named, but speculation
                        on social media soon identified him as the
                        former Tory party treasurer Lord McAlpine.
                        Unfortunately, it was a case of mistaken
                        identity: McAlpine was innocent. Within
                        days, the director general, George Entwistle
                        – just weeks into the job – had been forced
                        to resign. Meanwhile, the chairman, Chris
                        Patten, talked publicly about “a tsunami
                        of filth” engulfing the corporation.
                        A second investigation saw High Court
                        judge Dame Janet Smith spend nearly four
                        years interviewing more than 380 witnesses.
                        Her findings, published in 2016, revealed
                        that a catalogue of sexual assaults had indeed
                        taken place. She identified more than
                        70 allegations of inappropriate conduct or
                        sexual assault, many of them associated with
                        TV shows Top of the Pops and Jim’ll Fix It.
                        There had been no institutional cover-up,
                        she concluded, but those who had witnessed
                        Savile’s behaviour had repeatedly failed to
                        pass on complaints. Staff had been more
                        concerned with damage to the BBC’s
                        reputation than victims’ welfare.</p>
